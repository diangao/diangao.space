I recently started reading *My Life in Full*, the autobiography of Indra Nooyi, former CEO of PepsiCo. At first, it was just part of my prep for stepping into the American workplace—figured I’d gain some insights from a woman who had navigated these spaces as an immigrant and risen to the top. But a third of the way in, I realized the book mostly recounts her life experiences, with scattered mentions of how much people around her admired and respected her.  

That wasn’t what I was looking for. I wanted to know **why** she earned that level of recognition. What made her presence so undeniable? Why did everyone who worked with her hold her in such high regard?  

So, I turned to YouTube. Amid all the interviews emphasizing her identity (woman, person of color, immigrant), I found one from a UCLA Anderson talk 10 years ago—[this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WhnyfWhtNc). And this was what I was looking for: her thinking, her strategic sharpness, the way she carried herself. It wasn’t just impressive—it was magnetic.  

Here are some things I took away, not just from what she said, but how she thinks:  

- Language ability is a window into thinking. Strong thinking and strong communication are inseparable—you can't have one without the other.  
- **Know all the details of your business.** If you don’t know the details, you don’t know the truth. If you don’t know the truth, you can’t analyze. And if you can’t analyze, you can’t own your decisions.  
- Mastering general knowledge—deeply and precisely—earns you global perspective and respect. People respect decision-makers who actually know what they’re talking about.  
- Commitment and dedication are the only currencies for growth. No shortcuts.  
- Express gratitude and acknowledge the people who work with you. No one builds anything alone.

### Indra's Advice to Young People (from 10 years ago):  

1. There’s no substitute for deep engagement and hard work.  
2. In the early stages of your life, invest in your communication skills.  
   - "Learn how to motivate people. Learn how to write in a way that’s pithy and to the point."  
3. **Don’t take a job just as a stepping stone to the next.**  
   - "Don’t waste your time running for office. When you do a job, do it very well—your next job will come to you."

And P.S. — I see how *Qi* is cultivated through the best of corporate America. The way they talk, the way they carry themselves, the precision and effort they put into their work—it’s all intentional. They know how to motivate people.
