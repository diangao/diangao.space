Assuming "aha moments" are strongly correlated with emergent reflective ability (even though we are not sure yet), as someone who has experienced both educational systems, here are my thoughts:

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) works a lot like the Western education system—feed you a ton of examples, train you to mimic patterns, and in the short term, you perform well. But as the dataset scales, the marginal improvements shrink. Reinforcement Learning (RL), on the other hand, doesn't just hand you answers. It operates on trial and error, rewarding reasoning over rote memorization. Over time, it leads to deeper cognitive development, the kind of insights that trigger "aha moments" and other new emergent properties.

That got me thinking about how innovation is cultivated. The Western narrative often criticizes China's "severe test prepping" for stifling creativity. But if you frame it through RL vs. SFT, innovation isn't some innate trait—it's something that can be shaped through the right reinforcement structures. China's historical lack of innovation wasn't a result of its education system. Innovation is a pragmatic choice, not a limitation.  

For the past few decades, China's strategic priorities were centered around rapid economic growth, large-scale infrastructure development, and closing the gap with global market leaders. In that context, efficiency trumped originality—adopting and adapting existing innovations was simply the fastest route to progress. But this does not equate to a lack of innovative capacity.

The assumption that "China lacked innovation" conflates strategic optimization with inherent capability. **Innovation is not just a function of talent or education—it's a response to incentives, constraints, and systemic needs.** When speed, scale, and stability were the dominant imperatives, the rational choice was to prioritize execution over experimentation.

The real distinction isn't between "a country that innovates" and "a country that doesn't." It's between a system optimized for exploration versus one optimized for acceleration. For much of its development trajectory, China made a deliberate choice: **it didn't lack the ability to innovate—it simply had more pressing, high-yield alternatives.** Misinterpreting this choice as a deficiency distorts discussions on innovation and overlooks the conditions under which breakthrough ideas emerge.
