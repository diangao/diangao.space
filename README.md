## Inspiration
The inspiration behind www.diangao.space was to create a space that bridges my passions for cognitive science, technology, and creativity. I've always been fascinated by how these fields intersect and shape the way we interact with the digital world. Through this project, I wanted to document my journey and share the projects that have shaped my perspective on technology’s role in everyday life.

## What I Learned
Building this project has been an exercise in both technical skills and creative storytelling. I learned how to balance functionality with aesthetic design, aiming to create an experience that’s not only useful but also engaging. Diving into the world of web development, I explored everything from responsive design principles to user experience (UX) strategies, gaining a deeper understanding of how subtle design choices can shape user interaction.

## Final Thoughts
www.diangao.space is an ongoing project, a place to continuously evolve and document new ideas. I hope it serves as both a personal archive and a source of inspiration for others who are passionate about the intersection of art and technology.
