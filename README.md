# DianGao.Space

I built this space to hold the things I care about—my projects, thoughts, and the quiet moments I capture through my lens. Growing up in Kunming shaped how I see the world, and that perspective flows through every pixel here.

## The Story Behind

This isn't just a portfolio; it's more like a digital garden where I plant ideas and watch them grow. Some projects are about pushing what AI can do, others are about making life a bit better for people like those I grew up with. Each one carries a piece of what I believe technology should be—thoughtful, accessible, and genuinely helpful.

## How It's Built

Built with Next.js, but that's just the foundation. What matters more is how it feels to move through these pages. I wanted it to feel like walking through a well-tended garden—each transition smooth, each interaction natural. The design borrows from both my Chinese roots and the years I spent studying in the West.

## Looking Forward

This space will grow as I do. New projects will find their home here, new thoughts will take shape in writing, and new moments will be frozen in photographs. It's a living document of my journey through tech, design, and the spaces in between.
